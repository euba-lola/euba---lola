# Hi, I'm Euba Morenikeji!

**Registered Dietitian | MSc Nutritional Sciences | Data for Health Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about using data and research to drive better health outcomes. With a background in clinical nutrition, community-based interventions, and nutritional epidemiology, I’m now expanding my skills in **Python**, **R**, and **data science** to explore the connections between **diet**, and the **human health**.

## What I'm Working On

- **Nutrition + Data Science**: Transforming raw datasets into insights that improve health policies and dietary behavior
- **Web Scraping & Automation**: Collecting public health and food data from websites for real-world analysis
- **Open Science**: Creating reproducible, well-documented Jupyter Notebooks for research transparency

---

## Skills & Tools

- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup), R (ggplot2, tidyverse)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, Canva (for science communication)
- **Research**: Systematic reviews, community nutrition interventions, literature synthesis
- **Design**: Visual storytelling for research posters, presentations, and health outreach
